    "In this notebook we will show what types of references are supported by semantique. Remember that result instructions in query recipes can be formulated by combining basic building blocks into processing chains. These processing chains start with a *reference*. At the query recipe construction stage, such a reference is nothing more than a small piece of text. When executing the recipe, the query processor solves this reference and evaluates it internally into a multi-dimensional array filled with data values. Several actions can then be applied to this array. For a description of those, see the [Verbs notebook](verbs.ipynb). The same building blocks can also be used when constructing a set of mapping rules according to semantiques native mapping configuration.\n",

    "The most common reference in a query recipe is a reference to a semantic concept, i.e. a conceptualization of something that exists in the real world. The application expert writing the recipe can refer to any semantic concept by using the general [concept()](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.concept.html) function, which should be provided with the index of the semantic concept in the mapping dictionary that will be used to process the query against. The depth of this index depends on the structure of the ontology to which the mapping refers. Usually, an ontology does not only formalize the semantic concepts themselves, but also formalizes a categorization of these concepts. That is, a reference to a specific semantic concept usually consists of the name of that concept, *and* the name of the category it belongs to. Optionally there can be multiple hierarchies of categories. The [concept()](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.concept.html) function allows as many levels as needed, starting with the lowest-level category, and ending with the name of the semantic concept itself.\n",

    "## Referencing the active evaluation object\n",
    "\n",
    "Before explaining these type of references, we need to introduce some slightly more advanced processing chain structures. Remember that a processing chain starts with a reference, and that this reference will internally be evaluated into an array when processing the query recipe. Specific actions, called [verbs](verbs.ipynb), can then be applied to this array. This can be a single verb, but also a chain of multiple verbs. The array is constantly wrangled when moving through the verbs of the processing chain. It starts as the evaluated reference. This object will be the input to the first verb, which wrangles it into a different array. That array will then be the input to the second verb, which again wrangles it into a different array, etcetera. We use the term **active evaluation object** to refer to the input object at each stage of the processing chain. Hence, at the first verb, the active evaluation object is the evaluated reference. At the second verb, the active evaluation object is the output of the first verb, etcetera.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some verbs combine information of multiple inputs. For example, the [evaluate()](verbs.ipynb#Evaluate) verb lets you evaluate bivariate expressions in which the left-hand side of the expression is the active evaluation object, and the right-hand side of the expression is another array. This leads to nested processing chains. For example, adding the values of a vegetation count map to the values of a water count map:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sq.entity(\"water\").reduce(\"count\", \"time\").evaluate(\"add\", sq.entity(\"vegetation\").reduce(\"count\", \"time\"))\n",

    "sq.entity(\"water\").reduce(\"count\", \"time\").evaluate(\"add\", sq.entity(\"water\").reduce(\"count\", \"time\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you see that the *same* processing chain that constructs the water count map occurs twice in the recipe. This does not only make the code longer and less readable, it also decreases processing time since solving the water reference and reducing the resulting array has to be done twice instead of once. Now we came at the point where we can show that it is useful to reference the active evaluation object itself. The [self()](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.self.html) function can be used for that, without the need to provide any arguments."
