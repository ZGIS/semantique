    "# Semantic querying of earth observation data\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantique (to be pronounced with sophisticated French accent) is a structured framework for semantic querying of earth observation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of a semantic query is the **query recipe**. It contains instructions that together formulate a recipe for inference of new knowledge. These instructions can be grouped into multiple **results**, each representing a distinct piece of knowledge. A semantic query recipe is different from a regular data cube query statement because it allows you to refer directly to real-world concepts by their name, without having to be aware how these concepts are actually represented by the underlying data, and all the technical implications that come along with that. For example, you can ask how often *water* was observed at certain locations during a certain timespan, without the need to specify the rules that define how the collected data should be used to infer if an observation can actually be classified as being *water*. \n",
    "\n",
    "These rules are instead specified in a separate component which we call the **ontology**. It maps *a priori* knowledge of the real world to the data values in the image domain. Hence, an ontology is a repository of rulesets. Each ruleset uniquely defines a **semantic concept** that exists in the real world, by formulating how this concept is represented by collected data (which may possibly be [semantically enriched](https://doi.org/10.3390/data4030102) to some extent). Usually, these rules describe a binary relationship between the data values and the semantic concepts (i.e. the rules can be evaluated to either \"true\" or \"false\"). For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "> IF data value a > x AND data value b < y THEN water\n",
    "\n",
    "The data and information layers are stored together in a **factbase**. A factbase is described by its layout, which is a repository of metadata objects. Each metadata object describes the content of a specific **resource** of data or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ontology and a factbase should be provided when executing a semantic query recipe, together with the spatio-temporal extent in which the query should be evaluated. The query recipe itself is independent from these components. To some extent, at least. Of course, when you refer to a concept named \"water\" in your query recipe, it can only be executed alongside an ontology that defines how \"water\" can be represented by collected data, and a factbase that acutally contains these data. Unfortunately, we can't do magic.. However, the query recipe itself does not contain any information nor cares about how \"water\" is defined, and all the technical details that come along with that. There is a clear separation between the *definitions of the concepts* (these are stored as rules in the ontology) and *how these definitions are applied to infer new knowledge* (this is specified as instructions in the query recipe). \n",
    "\n",
    "That also means that query recipes remain fairly stable even when concepts are defined in a different way. For example, if we have a new technique to utilize novel data source for water detection from space, the factbase and the ontology change. The factbase needs to contain these novel data sources, and the ontology needs to implement rules that use the new technique for water detection. However, the query *how often was water observed* remains the same, since in itself it does not contain any information on how water is defined. This is in line with the seperation between the *world domain* and the *image domain*. Concepts in the world domain are fairly stable, while data and techniques in the image domain constantly change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the explicitly separated structure makes the semantic EO data querying process as implemented in semantique different from regular EO data querying, where this separation is usually not clear, and the different components are weaved together into a single query statement. Thanks to this structure, semantique is useful for those user groups that lack the advanced technical knowledge of EO data, but can benefit from the applications of it in their specific domain. Furthermore, it eases interoperability of EO data analysis workflows, also for expert users.\n",

    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "In semantique, a semantic query is processed by a query processor, with respect to a given ontology and factbase, and within the bounds of a given spatio-temporal extent. Below we will describe in more detail how semantique allows you to construct the required components for query processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The query recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the semantic querying process is to construct the query recipe for inference of new knowledge. That is, you have to write *instructions* that tell the query processor what steps it should take to obtain your desired result. In semantique you can do this in a flexible manner, by combining basic building blocks with each other. Each building block represents a specific component of a result instruction, like a reference to a semantic concept or a certain processing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with an empty query recipe:"

  },

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Such a [`QueryRecipe`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.QueryRecipe.html) object has the same structure as a dictionary, with each element containing the instructions for a specific result. You can request as many results as you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have to fill the empty query recipe by adding the instructions for all of our desired results one by one to our initialized recipe object. We do this by combining semantique's building blocks together in **processing chains**. A processing chain always has a *with-do structure*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the *with* part, you attach a block that contains a **reference** to an object that contains data or information. We call this the *input object* of the processing chain. The query processor will evaluate this reference into a multi-dimensional array containing a set of data values, and usually having at least a spatial and a temporal dimension. Each cell in this array is called a *pixel* and represents an observation on a specific location in space at a specific moment in time. We also call the array a **data cube**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases the reference in the *with* part of the processing chain will be a reference to a real-world semantic concept defined in an ontology. If the rules in the ontology describe *binary relationships* between the semantic concepts and the pixel values, the corresponding data cube will be boolean, with \"true\" values (i.e. 1) for those pixels that are identified as being an observation of the referenced concept, and \"false\" values (i.e. 0) for all other pixels in the spatio-temporal extent. In the [References notebook](references.ipynb) you can find an overview of all other types of references a processing chain may start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *do* part, you specify one or more **actions** that should be applied to the input object. Each action is a well-defined data cube operation that performs a *single* task. For example, applying a function to each pixel of a data cube, reducing a particular dimension of a data cube, filtering the pixels of a data cube based on some condition, et cetera. Each building block that represents such an action is labeled by an action word that should intuitively describe the operation it performs. Therefore we also call these type of building blocks **verbs**. In the [Verbs notebook](verbs.ipynb) you can find an overview of all implemented verbs and their functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> WITH input_object DO apply_first_action THEN apply_second_action THEN apply_third_action\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's show a basic example of how to construct such a processing chain. You can refer to any semantic concept by using the [`concept`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.concept.html#semantique.concept) function. How to specify the reference, depends on the structure of the ontology that the query will be processed against. Usually, an ontology does not only list rulesets of semantic concepts, but also formalizes a categorization of these concepts. That is, a reference to a specific semantic concept usually consists of the name of that concept, *and* the name of the category it belongs to. Optionally there can be multiple hierarchies of categories, for example to group concepts of different semantic levels (e.g. an entity *water body* is of a lower semantic level than an entity *lake*, since lake is by definition always a water body, but a water body not necessarily a lake). See the [Ontology section](#The-ontology) for details. The [`concept`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.concept.html#semantique.concept) function lets you specify as many levels as you need, starting with the lowest-level category, and ending with the name of the semantic concept itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common lowest-level categorization groups the semantic concepts into very abstract types. For example, a semantic concept might be an *entity* (a phenonemon with a distinct and independent *existence*, e.g. a forest or a lake) or an *event* (a phenonemon that *takes place*, e.g. a fire or a flood). If the semantic concepts are stored as direct element of these lowest-level categories without any further subdivision, we can refer to a semantic concept such as *water body* as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE** <br/> Currently we only focus on pixel based queries. Hence, the query processor evaluates for each pixel if the observed phenonemon in that pixel is *part of* a given entity or not, considering only the data value of the pixel itself. The semantique framework is flexible enough to also support object-based approaches. In that case te rulesets of concepts should look further than only individual pixels. Creating such rulesets is still a challenge.."

    "### The factbase\n",
    "\n",
    "The factbase is the place where the raw EO data and possibly derived information layers are stored. As mentioned before, the factbase is supposed to have a *layout* file that describes its content. This file has a dictionary-like structure. Each of its elements is again a dictionary, and represents the highest-level category of resources. This nested, hierarchical structure continues depending on the amount of sub-categories, until the point where you reach a metadata object belonging to a specific resource. It summarizes the data values of that resource, and also contains information on where to find this resource inside the storage structure of the factbase. Unless you create your own factbase, you will usually not write a layout file from scratch. Instead, the factbase you are using should already come with a layout file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantique utilizes the layout file to create an internal model of the factbase. It pairs it with a **retriever function**. This function is able to read a reference to a specific resource, lookup its metadata object in the layout file, and use these metadata to retrieve the corresponding data values as a data cube from the actual data storage location.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the exact structure of a layout file (i.e. what metadata keys it exactly contains), as well as the way the retriever function has to retrieve the actual data values, heavily depends on the format of the data storage. Data may be stored on a database server utilizing some specific database management system, simply as files on disk, or whatever else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, semantique offers a flexible structure in which different factbase formats are modelled by different classes, with different retriever functions. All these classes inherit from an abstract base class named [`Factbase`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.factbase.Factbase.html#semantique.factbase.Factbase), which serves a general template for how a factbase should be modelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently semantique contains two built-in factbase formats. The first one is called [`Opendatacube`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.factbase.Opendatacube.html) and is tailored to usage with the EO specific [OpenDataCube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) database management system. This class has a OpenDataCube-specific retriever function that knows exactly how to retrieve data from this system. You would initialize an instance from this class as by providing it the layout file, as well as an OpenDataCube connection object. This object allows the retriever function to connect with the database server an actually retrieve data from it. Probably all factbase formats that store the data on a server will need such kind of a connection object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "factbase = sq.factbase.Opendatacube(layout, connection = datacube.Datacube())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second one is called [`GeotiffArchive`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.factbase.GeotiffArchive.html) and has a much simpler format that assumes each resource is stored as a GeoTIFF file within a single ZIP archive. This class contains a retriever function that knows how to load GeoTIFF files as multi-dimensional arrays in Python, and how to subset (and possibly also resample and/or reproject) them to a given spatio-temporal extent. Instead of a database connection, we provide the initializer with the location of the ZIP file in which the resources are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "factbase = sq.factbase.GeotiffArchive(layout, src = \"foo.zip\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future more built-in factbase formats might be added, but as user you can also write your own class for a specific factbase format that you use. See the [Advanced usage notebook](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_notebooks/advanced.html#Creating-custom-factbase-classes) for details. It is important to note that the query processor does not care at all what the format of the factbase is and how resources are retrieved from the factbase. It only cares about what input the retriever function accepts, and in what format it returns the retrieved resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our examples we will use the simpler [`GeotiffArchive`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.factbase.GeotiffArchive.html) factbase format. We have a set of [example resources](https://github.com/ZGIS/semantique/blob/main/demo/files/resources.zip) for a tiny [spatial extent](https://github.com/ZGIS/semantique/blob/main/demo/files/footprint.json) and only three different timestamps, as well as a [layout file](https://github.com/ZGIS/semantique/blob/main/demo/files/factbase.json) that contains all necessary metadata entries the retriever function of this format needs."

That is, it contains rulesets that define how real-world concepts and their properties are represented by the data in the factbase. By doing that, it also formalizes how concepts are categorized and how the relations between multiple concepts and/or their properties are structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "These rulesets are stored in a dictionary-like structure. Each of its elements is again a dictionary, and represents the highest-level category of concepts. This nested, hierarchical structure continues depending on the amount of sub-categories, until the point where you reach a ruleset defining a specific concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "In semantique, an ontology is always paired with a **translator function**. This function is able to read a reference to a specific concept, lookup its ruleset object in the ontology, and use these rules to translate the reference into a data cube. When the rules describe *binary relationships* between the semantic concepts and the data values, this data cube will be boolean, where pixels that are identified as being an observation of the concept get a a \"true\" value (i.e. 1), and the other pixels get a \"false\" value (i.e. 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the way the rules are specified, and therefore also the way they should be evaluated by the translator function, are not fixed. Basically, you can do this in any way you want. For example, your rules could be a set of parameters for a given machine learning model, and your translator a function that knows how to run that model with those parameters. Your rules could also be paths or download links to some Python scripts, and your translator a function that knows how to execute these scripts. Hence, just as the factbase models described before, the ontology models in semantique can have many different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, semantique offers a flexible structure in which different ontology formats are modelled by different classes, with different translator functions. All these classes inherit from an abstract base class named [`Ontology`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.ontology.Ontology.html), which serves a general template for how an ontology should be modelled. Currently there is only one built-in ontology format in semantique, called (unsurprisinly) [`Semantique`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.ontology.Semantique.html). We will introduce this format below. As a user you can also write your own class for a specific ontology format that you use by inheriting from the abstract [`Ontology`](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_generated/semantique.ontology.Ontology.html) class. See the [Advanced usage notebook](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/_notebooks/advanced.html#Creating-custom-ontology-classes) for details. It is important to note that the query processor does not care at all what the format of the ontology is and how it translated concept references. It only cares about what input the translator function accepts, and in what format it returns the translated concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the semantique specific ontology format. We can create an instance of it by providing a dictionary with rulesets that was shared with us. However, expert users can also create their own ontology from scratch. In that case, you'll start with an empty ontology, and iteratively fill it with rules afterwards:"

    "Lets first look deeper into the structure of concept definitions. Each concept is defined by one or more named **properties** it has. For example, a entity *lake* may be defined by its *color* (a blueish, water-like color) in combination with its *texture* (it has an approximately flat surface). That is, the ruleset of a semantic concept definition is a set of distinct property definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to construct rules that define a binary relationship between a property and the data values in the factbase. That is, the rules should define for each pixel in our data if it meets a specific property (\"true\"), or not (\"false\"). In the Semantique-format, we can do this by utilizing the same building blocks as we did for constructing our query recipe. The only difference is that a processing chain will now usually start with a reference to a factbase resource. During query processing, this reference will be send to the retriever function of the factbase, which will return a data cube filled with the requested data values. Then, pre-defined actions will be applied to this data cube. Usually these actions will encompass the evaluation of a comparison operator, in which the value of each pixel is compared to some constant (set of) value(s), reuturning a \"true\" value (i.e. 1) when the comparison holds, and a \"false\" value (i.e. 0) otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: we utilize the \"Color type\" resource to define if a pixel has a water-like color. This resource is a layer of semantically enriched data and contains categorical values. The categories with indices `21`, `22`, `23` and `23` correspond to color combinations that *appear* to be water. Hence, we state that a pixel meets the color property of a lake when its value in this \"Color type\" resource corresponds with one of the above mentioned indices. Furthermore, we state that a pixel meets the texture property of a lake when its value in the \"slope\" resource equals 0."

    "Do note how the water count map contains many pixels that are counted as water but are clearly not water in the real world. Instead, these pixels correspond to observations in the shadow of a mountain. The color of water and shadow on a satellite image is very similar. Since in our ontology we only defined water based on its *color* property, it cannot differtiate it from shadow. This shows how important it is for accurate results to use multiple properties in entity definitions!"
