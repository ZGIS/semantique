    "The rules in the mapping should support computational inference on the pixel level. That is, for each spatio-temporal location contained in the EO data cube, they should be able to quantify a relation to the semantic concept. Such a relation may be binary, stating if the concept was observed at the location or not. However, relations may also be numeric (e.g. a probability that the concept was observed) or ordinal (e.g. \"likely\" or \"very likely\" that the concept was observed). It is important to emphasize here that there is no limitation to formulate rules as a function of only the data values of the pixel to which they are applied. In order to quantify the relations more accurately, the EO expert may exploit all the values in the EO data cube. For example, they may analyze spatial or temporal patterns around the location of the pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the rules are formulated in practice depends largely on the approach that the EO expert decides to take. This can be entirely knowledge-driven, but also hybrid approaches combining knowledge-driven and data-driven components are possible. For example, a rule may interpret the prediction of a machine learning classifier. Approaches can also differ in how they encode the formulated rules. We refer to all these different approaches as different *configurations* of a mapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of semantique is flexible and does not put any limitations on what the configuration of a mapping should be. Instead, it allows expert users to create their own class that implements their specific mapping configuration. Such a class should always inherit from the abstract base class [Mapping](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/semantique.mapping.Mapping.html) that semantique contains. Such a base class can be seen as a blueprint for any object that represents a mapping."

Given a textual reference to a semantic concept, it is able to apply the corresponding rules to the data values in the EO data cube, and return for each pixel the quantified relation with the semantic concept.

    "## The Semantique configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantique formalizes its own native mapping configuration through the [Semantique](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/semantique.mapping.Semantique.html) sub-class. It implements a knowledge-driven approach in which the EO expert formulates rules that quantify binary relations between properties of semantic concepts and data values, rather than directly from semantic concepts to data values. For example, a entity *lake* may be defined by its *color* (a blueish, water-like color) in combination with its *texture* (it has an approximately flat surface). These property relations are then combined with a logical “and” operator to quantify the relation for the semantic concept as a whole, meaning that the concept is only observed if all its properties are observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate the rules for each property, the EO expert can use the same building blocks as made available for [writing query recipes](recipes.ipynb), and combine them into processing chains. However, where in a query recipe such a processing chain usually start with a [reference to a semantic concept](references.ipynb#Referencing-semantic-concepts), in the mapping they will usually start with a [reference to a data layer](references.ipynb#Referencing-data-layers) in the EO data cube. Such a reference can then be directly followed by an [evaluate verb](verbs#Evaluate) that evaluates a condition on the data values of one or more layers. More complex rules can be formulated by utilizing more verbs, and nesting multiple processing chains into each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will show some examples on how you can construct rules with the Semantique mapping configuration. They are heavily simplified and don't always make sense, but are meant mainly to get an idea of how the mapping construction works. First, we need to create an instance of the Semantique class, which inherits from the abstract base class Mapping. We can create an instance of it by providing a dictionary with rules that was shared with us. However, when creating a mapping from scratch, we start with an empty mapping, and iteratively fill it with rules afterwards."

That is, the rules should define for each pixel in our data if it meets a specific property (\"true\"), or not (\"false\"). As said, we can do this by applying the same building blocks as we did for constructing our query recipe, but now starting with a reference to a data layer in the EO data cube. For example: we utilize the (\"appearance\", \"colortype\") data layer in the EO data cube to define if a pixel has a water-like color. This is a layer of semantically enriched data and contains categorical values. The categories with indices 21, 22, 23 and 24 correspond to color combinations that *appear* to be water. Hence, we state that a pixel meets the color property of a lake when its value in the (\"appearance\", \"colortype\") corresponds with one of the above mentioned indices. Furthermore, we state that a pixel meets the texture property of a lake when its value in the (\"topography\", \"slope\") layer equals 0."
